I am a Senior Lecturer and an ARC DECRA Fellow at Monash University. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPII) and a Lecturer at the University of Melbourne. I received my Ph.D. from the University of Western Australia, where I was primarily supervised by W/Prof Mohammed Bennamoun.

My research focuses on computer vision and machine learning, with particular interest in human action recognition, video understanding, generative AI, and multimodal large models.

I am always looking for self-motivated students to join my group as Ph.D./Masterâ€™s students or research assistants. If you're interested, feel free to reach out via email!
