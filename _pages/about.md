I am a Senior Lecturer and an ARC DECRA Fellow at Monash University. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPII) and a Lecturer at The University of Melbourne. I received the Ph.D. degree from The University of Western Australia under the primary supervision of W/Prof Mohammed Bennamoun.

My research is on computer vision and machine learning, with the special interests in human action recognition, video understanding, generative AI and multimodal large models.

I am looking for self-motivated students for Ph.D./Master degree, RA. Please drop me an email if you are interested.
